This project is part of my PhD developments at SNCF RÃ©seau, Sorbonne University and Mines Paris - PSL.

It consists in predictiong the groundwater table level from a dispersion curve using a Multilayer Perceptropn trained with real data.
Daily 2D maps are then constructed across the seislic array.
